You may edit this autoexec/cfg to fit your playstyle if you'd like to or don't like something about this.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE INSTALLING!!!
This autoexec will overwrite your Apex Legends controls! Please back them up by going to `C:\Users\[your-username-here]\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex` and save everything inside there. These files include your graphic settings, controls & keybinds, and everything else.

When you run the autoexec, these actions can't be undone, sorry!

## How to install
1. Download the autoexec file via the links above.
2. Go to your Apex Legends installation by right-clicking on "Apex Legends" in your Steam Library -- `Properties...` > `Installed Files` > `Browse...`
3. Go into the `cfg/` folder and copy and paste the autoexec into that folder.
4. Launch Apex Legends, load up into any game and press the `F10` key on your keyboard.
5. When you see whatever you're holding be interacted, that means the autoexec did its thing.

## So what does this do/change?
- Change crosshair color & color-blind mode when moving left or right.
- Bind `X` for BOTH destorying spikes & reinforcing doors for my Catalyst mains out there.
- 120 FOV "patch"
- Audio patches
- Zoomed sensitivity settings (Should be changed if making a big `mouse_sensitivity` adjustment)
